#Test 1 - Question 30
#This program contains the task required for this assignment.

#Task 1
#Given a tax table below, write a Python program that asks a user to enter a single personâ€™s taxable income for the year, output the taxable income, tax due, and the after tax income.
#I interpreted the output taxable income to be the same as input taxable income, as that's what I think the question meant.

        taxDue = 932.50 + ((preIncome - 9325) * 0.15)
        postIncome = preIncome - taxDue

#Task 2
'''Use a while loop to ask user to repeatedly enter a positive integer n. If a zero or negative number is entered, the while loop terminates.
For each positive number n entered, use a for loop (inside the while loop) to calculate the result = 22 + 32 + ... + n2 + (n+1)2  and display the result.
Test your code once, with the following input numbers: 10, 25, -1.'''

#Task 3
'''Write a function f that takes two parameters x, y with default values for x is 1 and for y is 5, and it returns x2+y3. 
Write a main function that includes the following calls: (1) f()   (2) f(y=1, x=5)   (3) ask a user to enter x, and y and then call f(x,y). 
The main function will print out the return value for each of the function calls respectively. Run the main to execute.'''
